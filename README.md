# Requirements  
In order to use this backend you need to install wamp server or any server to be able to run a MySQL instance. You can use the Flutter app located in [this repository](http:wwwww).  

You have to create a .env file too, with the PORT and DB_PORT variables, and the HOST as well, something like this:
```
HOST=localhost
PORT=8050
DB_PORT=3306
```
